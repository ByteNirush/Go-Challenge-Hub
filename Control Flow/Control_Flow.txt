Control flow is fundamental to programming, allowing us to dictate the order in which code is executed based on conditions and iterations. Without control flow statements, programs would execute sequentially, line by line, offering limited flexibility. This lesson explores the core control flow mechanisms in Go: if/else statements for conditional execution, for loops for repetitive tasks, and switch cases for multi-way branching. Mastering these constructs is essential for building complex and dynamic applications.

If/Else Statements:
if/else statements enable conditional execution of code blocks. The if statement evaluates a boolean expression, and if the expression is true, the code block within the if statement is executed. Optionally, an else block can be provided, which is executed if the if condition is false. Go also supports else if for chaining multiple conditions.

Loops
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Go provides only one looping construct, the for loop, but it's versatile and can be used in several ways.

Switch Cases
The switch statement is a multi-way branch statement that provides an efficient way to transfer execution to different parts of code based on the value of an expression.


No break Statement Needed
Unlike some other languages, Go does not require a break statement at the end of each case. Execution automatically stops after the matching case is executed. To achieve fallthrough behavior, use the fallthrough keyword.

fallthrough Keyword
The fallthrough keyword forces execution to continue to the next case, regardless of whether the next case matches the expression.

Short Variable Declaration in switch Statements
Similar to if statements, you can declare a variable within the switch statement. The scope of this variable is limited to the switch block.
