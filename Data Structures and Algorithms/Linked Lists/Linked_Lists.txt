Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science, offering a dynamic way to store and manipulate collections of data. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size, linked lists can grow or shrink as needed, making them suitable for situations where the number of elements is unknown or changes frequently. This lesson will delve into the implementation of linked lists in Go, covering the core concepts, different types of linked lists, and practical examples. We'll explore how to create, traverse, insert, and delete nodes in a linked list, providing a solid foundation for understanding more complex data structures and algorithms.

Understanding Linked Lists
    A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains two parts: the data itself and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the head, and the last node's pointer points to nil, indicating the end of the list.

Core Concepts
    Node: The basic building block of a linked list. It contains the data and a pointer to the next node.
    Head: The first node in the linked list. It serves as the entry point for traversing the list.
    Next Pointer: A pointer within each node that points to the next node in the sequence.
    Tail: The last node in the linked list. Its next pointer is nil.

Types of Linked Lists
There are several types of linked lists, each with its own characteristics and use cases:
    Singly Linked List: Each node points only to the next node in the sequence. This is the simplest type of linked list.
    Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes in the sequence. This allows for bidirectional traversal.
    Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.
    

Implementing a Singly Linked List in Go
    Let's start by implementing a singly linked list in Go. We'll define the Node and LinkedList structs, and then implement methods for common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.


Implementing Insertion
    We'll implement two insertion methods: InsertAtBeginning and InsertAtEnd.

Implementing Deletion
    We'll implement a DeleteWithValue method to delete a node with a specific value.

Implementing Traversal
    We'll implement a Display method to print the elements of the linked list.
