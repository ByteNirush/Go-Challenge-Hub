Pointers are a fundamental concept in Go that allows you to work directly with memory addresses. Understanding pointers is crucial for efficient memory management, creating complex data structures, and optimizing performance. This lesson will provide a comprehensive introduction to pointers, covering their declaration, usage, and relationship to memory management in Go. We'll explore how pointers enable you to manipulate data indirectly, leading to more flexible and powerful code.

Understanding Pointers:
    A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding the actual value, it "points" to the location in memory where that value is stored. This indirection allows you to modify the original value through the pointer.

Memory Management in Go:
    Go has automatic memory management through garbage collection. This means that you don't need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory like in some other languages (e.g., C or C++). However, understanding how memory is managed can help you write more efficient Go code.

Garbage Collection
    The Go garbage collector (GC) automatically reclaims memory that is no longer being used by the program. It does this by periodically scanning the heap (the area of memory where dynamically allocated objects are stored) and identifying objects that are no longer reachable from any live pointers.

How Garbage Collection Works (Simplified)
    1. Allocation: When you create a new object (e.g., using new or by creating a struct), the memory for that object is allocated on the heap.
    2. Reachability: The GC determines which objects are "reachable" by tracing pointers from root objects (e.g., global variables, local variables on the stack). If an object is reachable, it is considered to be in use.
    3. Marking: The GC marks all reachable objects.
    4. Sweeping: The GC sweeps the heap, freeing the memory occupied by unmarked objects (i.e., objects that are no longer reachable).
